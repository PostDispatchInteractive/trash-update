Overview: 

This City of St. Louis Citizens' Service Bureau dataset contains comma delimited (CSV) files, with headings in the first row. All values are inside double quotes. 

There is one CSV file for each year. So 2017.csv would contain service request data from 01-01-2017 through 12-31-2017. 

Note that the 2008 data includes Traffic and Streets requests only (soft launch of record system). 

Notes for Excel and LibreOffice users: 

    - Date/time fields (and possibly others) might not be displayed properly by default, you will likely want to change the cell formatting.
    
    - Excel and LibreOffice struggle with over 1 million rows, so importing all of the files at once may not work.
